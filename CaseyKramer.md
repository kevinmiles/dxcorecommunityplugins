## Who am I ##
My name is Casey Kramer. I am a .Net developer, agile enthusiast, and CodeRush fan since 2007.  Currently my list of plugins seems to be rather skewed towards working TDD, not sure if this will change or not :)


## Plugins ##
Here are some links to some of the plugins I have written:
<table border='0'>
<tr>
<td valign='Top'>
<ul><li><a href='CR_MoveFile.md'>CR_MoveFile</a>
</li><li><a href='CR_CreateTestMethod.md'>CR_CreateTestMethod</a>
</li><li><a href='CR_NavigateToTest.md'>CR_NavigateToTest</a>
</li><li><a href='CR_ShouldBeDisposable.md'>CR_ShouldBeDisposable</a>
</li><li><a href='CR_CCConsole.md'>CR_CCConsole</a>
</td></tr>
</table></li></ul>

[CR\_CreateTestMethod](CR_CreateTestMethod.md) contains a slew of other bits related to TDD, which should probably be extracted into separate plug-ins to make things easier

It's worth noting that [CR\_CCConsole](CR_CCConsole.md) has not been touched for about a year now, since I'm not using CruiseControl.Net on a daily basis any longer.  I recall that it was working fairly well at one point though :)
