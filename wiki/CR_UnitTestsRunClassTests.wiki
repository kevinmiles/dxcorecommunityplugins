===== Built using DXCore 11.2 =====
=== Introduction ===

This plugin provides 2 new actions which may be bound to keys.

These actions are *!UnitTestsRunClassTests* and *!UnitTestsDebugClassTests*.

These function similarly to the other UnitTestsXXXXX actions, in that a given set of tests are either run or debugged depending on the action invoked.

This plugin will look for a class named similarly to the active class but with a suffix of {{{"_Tests"}}}. It will then run or debug all tests within that class.

So for example... when invoked from within a class '!MyClass', the plugin will look for a class called '!MyClass_Tests' and execute any tests within that.

The plugin will look for this class in several locations.
{{{
 - [OriginalNamespace].[SourceClass]_Tests (Original Project)
 - [OriginalNamespace].[SourceClass]_Tests (Other Projects)
 - [InitialOriginalNamespace]_Tests.[RemainingNamespace].[SourceClass]_Tests (Original Project)
 - [InitialOriginalNamespace]_Tests.[RemainingNamespace].[SourceClass]_Tests (Other Projects)
}}}
If none of these are found, the plugin will search all classes in all solutions, looking for the first one called {{{[SourceClass]_Tests}}}

The first of these, if any, to be found will have any tests found within it executed.

=== Configuration ===
Simply [http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/rorybecker/archive/2010/10/05/binding-keys-in-coderush.aspx add bindings] to *!UnitTestsRunClassTests* and *!UnitTestsDebugClassTests*

=== Usage ===

Invoke the provided actions using the bound shortcuts from within a class which has a corresponding {{{_Test}}} class
