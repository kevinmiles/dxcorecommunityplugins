===== Requires DXCore 10.2 since build 1540 =====
= Introduction =

I used to use TestDriven.Net before it required a license purchase. I loved it's Ad Hoc test run feature. This plug-in reproduces the behavior without a right click.

= Details =

When you create a method that takes no parameters, Impromptu will place a gear icon to the left of the method signature.

If you click on the icon, Impromptu will use reflection to execute your method. The results are put into an output window and the window is automatically displayed.

The first line displays details about what method was run.
Any following lines will be the results of your method. Results come from two places: First, anything your method writes to the Console are captured. Second, if your method has a return value, it is written using the default ToString() method.
