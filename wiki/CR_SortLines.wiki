= Introduction =

I sort lines a lot in text editing. That's another feature Visual Studio didn't have that I wanted - the ability to sort lines. `CR_SortLines` adds a command ("Sort Lines") that you can bind to a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+F9 is what I use) and will sort lines in the code editor.

= Installation =

  # Make sure all instances of Visual Studio are closed.
  # Copy the `CR_SortLines.dll` assembly into your DXCore plug-ins folder.  This is typically something like: C:\Program Files\Developer Express Inc\DXCore for Visual Studio NET\2.0\Bin\Plugins
  # Open Visual Studio.
  # From the !DevExpress menu, select "Options," then "IDE/Shortcuts" from the treeview on the side.
  # Add a new shortcut. Bind a key to the command "!SortLines" and set the context to "Focus/Documents/Source/Code Editor". (Hint: You can copy the "Code Editor" context from any existing command shortcut and paste it into your new shortcut by right-clicking.)
  # Click "OK" to close the options window.

= Usage =

Once installed and bound to a keyboard shortcut (as noted above):

  # Open a text document in the code editor in Visual Studio.
  # Without selecting anything, enter the keyboard shortcut to activate the command.  The sort dialog will pop up and ask you for sort options.  You must have at least two lines in the document or nothing will happen.
  # Select multiple lines then enter the keyboard shortcut to activate the command.  The sort dialog will pop up and ask you for sort options.  You must have at least two lines selected or nothing will happen.

== Delete Duplicate Lines ==
Checking the "delete duplicate lines" box will remove all of the duplicate lines found during the sort.  Duplicates are removed such that the first encountered version of a duplicate that is encountered is kept.  This is important to remember when sorting using sort expressions (see below).  When sorting without expressions, lines are considered duplicate if their original versions match.  When sorting using sort expressions, lines are considered duplicate if their sort expression version matches.

== Match/Sort Expressions ==
Line match and sort expressions (as seen in the sort options dialog that pops up when you execute the sort command) are an easy way to sort lines based on a section of text in each line or a particular property of each line.  When the match and sort expressions are used, the sort algorithm matches each line against the line match expression, then executes a replace with the sort expression.  The lines in the document are then sorted by the regular expression replaced version of the line rather than by the original text.

For example, to sort lines ignoring whitespace at the beginning of each line use:
||Line match expression||`^\s*(.+)$`||
||Sort expression||`$1`||

Or to sort a list of variable declarations in C# by variable name rather than type, use:
||Line match expression||`^.*([^\s;]+);$`||
||Sort expression||`$1`||

Sorting with expressions may take some experimentation to get used to, but it can be handy, especially if sorting, say, tab-delimited data or some such.
