= Introduction =

This plugin adds 1 code issue together with 2 possible fixes:
  * 'StackOverflowException in runtime' code issue
  * 'Change to base call' refactoring - available when code issue is reported for overriden property. Changes recursive call into call to base implementation of property
  * 'Change to field call' refactoring - available always when code issue is reported. Changes recursive call into field call.

'StackOverflowException in runtime' code issue is reported when property calls itself recusively. Below code will report 2 issues, first for return statement in getter and second for assignment in setter:
{{{
public string PropertyName
{
    get
    {
        return PropertyName;
    }
    set
    {
        PropertyName = value;
    }
}
}}}

= Usage =

This plugin integrates itself with other code issues and refactorings provided by CodeRush. Features of this plugin are language independent.
