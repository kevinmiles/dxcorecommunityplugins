= Introduction =

Details about the features of this plugin can be found [http://jorgerowies.blogspot.com/2010/03/coderush-plugin-to-extract-nhibernates.html here].

Note for CodeRush plugin developers:

A secondary purpose of this plugin is to try to show how to link two (or more) pieces of source code in a way that changing one of them triggers the change to the others, like when you rename a variable with refactor/rename (F2) and all the references of that variable are renamed accordingly.

I did some research about how the renaming was done in CodeRush plugin Refactor_Renaming.dll and, taking some code from here and there, I came up with the following class:

http://code.google.com/p/dxcorecommunityplugins/source/browse/trunk/CR_ExtractHqlNamedQuery/CR_ExtractHqlNamedQuery/LinkedTextHelper.cs

Basically, to use this class you can do something like this:

{{{
          FileSourceRangeCollection collection = new FileSourceRangeCollection();
          collection.Add(
            new FileSourceRange(
              CodeRush.Source.Active.FileNode, 
              new SourceRange(1, 1, 1, 6))); //<- selects the first 5 characters in first line
          collection.Add(
            new FileSourceRange(
              CodeRush.Source.Active.FileNode,
              new SourceRange(2, 1, 2, 6))); //<- selects the first 5 characters in second line

          RefactoringContext context = new RefactoringContext(ea);
          LinkedTextHelper.ApplyRename(context, collection);
}}}

This will result in the following two pieces of code synchronized
