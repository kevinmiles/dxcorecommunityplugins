=== Introduction ===

This plugin determines the location of your settings and then watches them using a !FileSystemWatcher. If they should be changed by some external force, they will be reloaded.

=== Details === 

This plugin enables 2 specific scenarios:
 * CodeRush option changes in one instance of visual studio will be immediately reflected in another.
 * CodeRush option changes sync'd to one machine from another via service like Live Mesh will be immediately loaded into any running copies of Studio on the destination machine.

=== Usage ===

This plugin is entirely ambient and requires no interaction.

=== Credits ===
