# Introduction #

This plugin integrates StyleCop with CodeRush. It shows StyleCop warnings as code issues. Currently about half of StyleCop rules are implemented. Final release will provide fixes for most of violations and few features that should prevent the emergence of these violations.

This plugin requires StyleCop 4.4.1 to be installed.

First release will be available for download as soon as code issues for all rules are implemented.

# Usage #

This plugin integrates itself with other code issues and refactorings provided by CodeRush.
You can use it with CodeRush Express too. In order to do this, you need to install [CodeIssueAnalysis](CodeIssueAnalysis.md) plugin as well to provide UI for issues.

# Options #

Currently there is no options page.

# Future work #

  * Code issues for all rules
  * Fixes for most rules
  * Template for file header
  * Automatic correction of rule violations "as you type" without need to apply fixes manually
  * Options page
