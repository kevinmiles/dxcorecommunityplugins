#### What plugins are available from this site? ####

There are several types of plugins available through this site. All of them are offered free of charge under the MIT license.

Many of the plugins available through this site are listed on the left in the sidebar.
Not every plugin is listed there however. Some are not considered finished enough and have not yet been placed there.

These links will take you to individual plugin pages. These pages will describe each plugin in detail and provide links to Downloads, Install Help and, in some cases, Screencasts.

#### A word about downloads ####
In order to avoid as much version confusion as possible, the version of each plugin is tied to the version of the source-code repository from which it was built. This version number is built into the dll and is also found within the name of the downloaded zip file.

Because of the nature of the zip filenames, the download links point at the folder which contains the downloads, rather than at the zip file itself. This helps considerably when posting new versions.Prior versions of plugins are held in an archive folder beneath this folder.

We do not currently provide a download containing all plugins.

Important Note: The plugins listed on the left are not the only ones on this site. We have more... Just [peruse the wiki](http://code.google.com/p/dxcorecommunityplugins/w/list). Most (but not all) plugin pages are prefixed DX_or CR_ and if you're feeling really brave you can even skip past the wiki and just go [peruse the binary downloads](http://www.rorybecker.co.uk/DevExpress/Community/Plugins/) :)
