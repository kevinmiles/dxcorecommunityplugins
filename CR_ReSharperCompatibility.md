##### Requires DXCore 10.2 since build 1472 #####
# Introduction #

This is a simple plugin and a set of key bindings (listed below) designed to ease the process of moving from Resharper or just testing out CodeRush and RefactorPro from a Resharper user's point of view.

# Additional Install Help #

The shortcut xml files should be extracted to your Settings.xml\IDE folder. You can find the Settings.xml folder through the use of a button on the DevExpress 'About' dialog. Found on the DevExpress\About menu

Also you can type "%AppData%\CodeRush for VS.Net\" into your address bar and hit Enter

# Support #
Several Resharper functions are now supported using either VS or IntelliJ style key bindings

# Source #
Coderush, like this plugin, is build on top of the [DXCore](http://devexpress.com/dxcore) and the source to this plugin as with all [others on this site](http://code.google.com/p/dxcorecommunityplugins) is available free to all.

We would also like to encourage others to fill in any gaps that are felt to be missing :)

This page will be improved over time, but should be enough to get you started.
