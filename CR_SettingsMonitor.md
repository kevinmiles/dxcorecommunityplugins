### Introduction ###

This plugin determines the location of your settings and then watches them using a FileSystemWatcher. If they should be changed by some external force, they will be reloaded.

### Details ###

This plugin enables 2 specific scenarios:
  * CodeRush option changes in one instance of visual studio will be immediately reflected in another.
  * CodeRush option changes sync'd to one machine from another via service like Live Mesh will be immediately loaded into any running copies of Studio on the destination machine.

### Usage ###

This plugin is entirely ambient and requires no interaction.
