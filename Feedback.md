### Issues ###
The DevExpress Support Center is **not** the correct location for issues with community plugins. The authors of these plugins have no access to that site.

If you have an issue with a community plugin, please check our [list of issues](http://code.google.com/p/dxcorecommunityplugins/issues/list) and if yours is not listed then perhaps [add a new one](http://code.google.com/p/dxcorecommunityplugins/issues/entry)

### Author Pages ###
Some authors are happy to engage in some form of direct communication, and have created an author page (linked to from the credits section of relevant plugins). This page might contain contact information, such as email address or links to their blogs or twitter account.

### If all else fails ###
Well if all else fails then you should probably contact me directly. My name is Rory Becker, I am the founder of this site, and [my author page is here](RoryBecker.md)
