# Introduction #

This plug-in makes it easy to insert a comment that contains the developers name or initials and the date of a change. For example:

```
// PCM - 8/4/2008 -
```

Or, if you happen to be located on an XML comment line, it inserts the following:

```
/// <developer>Paul Mrozowski</developer>
/// <created>08/04/2008</created>
```

It's language agnostic, so it works in both C# or VB.NET. I've tied it to the CTRL-Insert keypress but you can set it to whatever you'd like.
