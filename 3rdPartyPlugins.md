    * [Electric Editing](http://www.sturmnet.org/blog/2005/04/24/cr-electric-editing) - Based on CodeRush, I created a plugin that lets me use some of the "electric" features I remember from Emacs: hungry delete and backspace and automatic newline insertion for the semicolon and the opening and closing curly braces.
    * [Instant Gratification](http://www.sturmnet.org/blog/2008/10/16/instant-gratification-for-developers) - With this plugin installed, every time you build a project successfully Visual Studio will sing your praise.
