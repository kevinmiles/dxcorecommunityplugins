This site is all about Free [DXCore](http://www.devexpress.com/Downloads/NET/IDETools/DXCore/) plugins for CodeRush and related products.

These plugins represent additional pieces of functionality for Visual Studio which are designed to improve your experience.

If you have a copy of [CodeRush](http://devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/Coding_Assistance/), [RefactorPro](http://devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/Refactoring/) or [CodeRush Xpress (FREE)](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/CodeRushX/) then you already have everything you need.

It's also worth noting that we are not the only source of DXCore plugins.
There are [some others out there](3rdPartyPlugins.md).
