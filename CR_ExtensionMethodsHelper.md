Community plugins are slowly being migrated to [GitHub](http://github.com).

This plugin has now been [relocated here](https://github.com/RoryBecker/CR_ExtensionMethodsHelper).

The latest release of this plugin is [available here](https://github.com/RoryBecker/CR_ExtensionMethodsHelper/releases/latest).

## Introduction ##

This plugin was created in response to a user request. Mark Miller [blogs about this in full here](http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/markmiller/archive/2011/03/23/importing-namespace-references-for-extension-methods-in-coderush-for-visual-studio.aspx)

The plugin adds a CodeProvider which adds missing namespace references for extension methods.

## Usage ##
Access the codeprovider through the CodeRush\Refactor key (Defaults to Ctrl+`) and choose **Add Namespace Reference**
