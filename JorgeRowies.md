# About Me #

I'm a developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I've been using CodeRush for about a couple of years now and I recently discovered the amazing power that the CodeRush plugin API has, so I decided to make some plugins that could make my every-day job a little easier ;)

You can find more about me in my [google profile](http://www.google.com/profiles/jorge.rowies) or in my [blog](http://jorgerowies.blogspot.com/)
