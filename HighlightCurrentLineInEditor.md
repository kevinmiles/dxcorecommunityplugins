### Obsolete ###
This plugin is now obsolete. The main reason for this, is that it's functionality is now included with CodeRush as standard. (See the Line Highlighter entry on [this blog post](http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/rorybecker/archive/2010/07/26/The-DXCore-Visualize-Toolbar.aspx))

This being the case, it is not deemed worth maintaining this plugin any further.

The original code will remain here in the code repository for those who are interested.

Note: The Line Highlighter source code is also shipped with CodeRush

### Introduction ###

This plugin (as it's name suggests) highlights the current line using 3 user configurable colors.
  * Outer Color: Border of the highlight bar.
  * Inner Color: The fill color of the highlight bar.
  * Text Color: The Color of the text highlighted.
